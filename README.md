This is used for creating the mobile game 2048 within circloO!
2048py.txt acts as the level file whcih can be directly fed into circloO's level editor. It is generated using Circlo2048.py, which requires GUI.txt to run. 

If you want help understanding the code, please just reach out to me directly; I know that this is VERY poorly documented!
